## 1. Diagnosis – Why **BATCH_001** Failed  

| Parameter | Observation | Why It Matters | Result in the Batch |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Reaction temperature** | **Mean = 374 °C, Max = 620 °C** | • Exceeds the thermal limits for most organometallic/aqueous routes.  <br>• 620 °C is 
essentially pyrolysis; it ruptures the solvent, decomposes the catalyst, and generates a host of char and secondary products. | The actual capacity 
dropped from the 0.86 mmol g⁻¹ forecast to only 0.10 mmol g⁻¹ – a 77 % loss in yield. |
| **pH trajectory** | 13.12 → 7.00 over 180 min | • A rapid drop to neutral indicates either premature neutralization or loss of base through 
side‑reactions (e.g., hydroxide reacting with high‑T by‑products).  <br>• At ~620 °C the solvent would partially decompose; pH probes at high 
temperature also become unreliable. | The base concentration that was supposed to promote the reaction was largely consumed before completion, 
stalling the key step. |
| **Residence time / duration** | 180 min | • At > 400 °C the reaction would normally complete in minutes, so prolonged exposure leads to product 
degradation. | The product decomposed, and side‑products accumulated, further lowering the effective conversion. |
| **Catalyst integrity** | Not listed, but implied | • Most transition‑metal catalysts cannot survive > 400 °C.  <br>• High temperatures cause 
leaching, sintering, and deactivation. | Catalyst likely deactivated long before the target selectivity could be achieved. |
| **Instrumentation & Control** | Implicit | • No mention of temperature‑jacketed heat‑transfer system or real‑time pH feedback.  <br>• Likely a 
single‑point reactor (oil bath) with poor heat distribution, leading to hot spots. | Thermal runaway and uneven reaction conditions caused 
inconsistent reaction performance. |

**Bottom line**: The batch was run under *pyrolytic* conditions that destroyed both the substrate and the catalyst, consumed the base, and produced a
heavily degraded product stream. The predicted capacity was therefore catastrophically over‑optimistic.

## 2. Optimization – Parameter Changes for the Next Experiment  

| Target Change | Suggested Value/Method | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| **Mean reaction temperature** | **↓ 50 °C** to 324 °C | Keeps the reaction in the *thermolysis* window (100–450 °C) while still enabling the key 
bond‑forming step. |
| **Maximum temperature (peak)** | **↓ 120 °C** to **500 °C** | Avoids char formation and catalyst deactivation. |
| **Temperature ramp protocol** | **Fast ramp to 350 °C, hold 60 min, then cool to 250 °C** | Allows the reaction to reach the necessary transition 
state before the temperature starts to jeopardize catalyst integrity. |
| **Stirring/Agitation** | **≥ 800 rpm, use a baffled or pitched‑blade impeller** | Even heat distribution, minimizes hot spots that caused local 
overheating. |
| **pH control** | • Use a *titration* or *continuous pH probe* with a *feedback loop* to maintain 13.2–13.5 until 90 % residence time.  <br>• Start 
with a larger stoichiometric excess of base (e.g., 1.5–2 eq. of NaOH) and add a controlled rate of a base alcohol (e.g., methanol) to buffer pH. | 
Ensures the base is not prematurely consumed by side‑products at high temperature; stable pH drives the desired pathway. |
| **Catalyst loading/selection** | • Increase loading by 25 % (if thermal tolerance allows).  <br>• Switch to a **thermally stabilized** catalyst, 
e.g., a supported palladium/Al₂O₃ or a bifunctional phosphine‑ligated Pd complex that can survive > 400 °C. | Compensates for small residual 
deactivation, keeps active sites in play. |
| **Residence‑time profile** | • Reduce total hold to 90–120 min (half of the failed 180 min).  <br>• Allow a *post‑reaction* cooling step (≤ 150 °C)
to quench side‑reaction pathways. | Prevents degradation of the desired product. |
| **Scale‑up method** | • Pilot using a *continuous reactor* (plug‑flow or counter‑current) to maintain uniform temperature and avoid hotspots. | 
Enables better heat management and more reproducible results. |
| **Instrumentation & safety** | • Install **inline temperature sensors** (thermocouple array) at several reactor zones.  <br>• Use a 
**temperature‑jacket** (water or oil) with a PID controller set to the new max temperature.  <br>• Add a **redundant pH probe** at the inlet and 
outlet with real‑time logging.  <br>• Add an **interruptive pressure relief** to catch any unforeseen buildup. | Guarantees that the reactor stays 
within the design envelope and protects personnel. |
| **Predictive model calibration** | • Run a series of *small* (10–50 mL) reference batches at the new conditions, measure true capacity, and update 
the capacity model. | Improves forecast accuracy and informs downstream scale‑up decisions. |

### Next‑step Summary

1. **Redesign the thermal profile**: Target a mean of 324 °C, max 500 °C, with a controlled temperature ramp.  
2. **Add robust pH buffering**: Maintain high pH until most reaction is complete, then allow neutralization during the cooling phase.  
3. **Upgrade instrumentation**: Use multiple temperature and pH probes with PID control to prevent runaway.  
4. **Select a heat‑tolerant catalyst**: Test one or two candidate catalysts to confirm activity after the new thermal stress.  
5. **Pilot‑scale test**: Run a 30–50 mL batch under the new conditions, measure actual capacity, adjust as needed before full‑scale production.  

With these changes, the process should avoid the catastrophic thermal decomposition that ruined BATCH_001, and bring the actual capacity close to the
predicted 0.86 mmol g⁻¹—ultimately achieving a high‑yield, clean product stream.
